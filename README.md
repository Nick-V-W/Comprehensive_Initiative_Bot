## $divine
$divine follows takes 1 argument. This arguement is the name of the channel in discord that you want this bot to read "stored" PC information from.
For example, ''$divine player-info'' will read in PC character info from the player-info channel in your discord server. If the channel you give 
$divine does not exist, you will need to $divine again with valid input. You will also need to $divine again if the bot ever goes offline (it will
notify you as such if you run any other command than $divine since the bot returning online if this is the case).
